# Agent rules: toolchain

This project's commands and project-only checks. Agents and skills name no
command of their own: they take every command from here.

## Tests agents run

| What                                           | Command                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Unit tests that import what the branch changed | `pnpm test:changed`                          |
| One unit test file                             | `pnpm exec vitest run --project unit <file>` |
| Fast e2e files (builds first)                  | `pnpm test:e2e <files>`                      |
| Console lane, Chromium only (1)                | `pnpm test:console --project=chromium`       |

(1) Only when the diff touches `ui/`, `e2e/console/`, `src/http/` or
`src/contract/`.

## Checks agents never run

Hooks and CI run these. Never run them by hand, and never the tools behind
them (from `node_modules/.bin` or any other path): `pnpm check`, `pnpm test`,
`pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm format:check`, `pnpm fallow`,
`pnpm mutate`, the whole e2e suite, the console lane in every browser
(`pnpm test:console`), `tsc`, `oxlint`, `oxfmt`, `fallow`, `stryker`.

- **Commit hook:** format, lint, typecheck. Errors show in its output.
- **Push hook:** Fallow, the e2e typecheck, then mutation testing on the
  lines the branch changed. It takes minutes. Its output lists every mutant
  left alive; a survivor does not block the push.
- **CI:** `pnpm check` and Fallow on every push. The console lane runs on
  every push to `main`, and on a pull request when it changes a source, UI,
  console spec or build file: in every browser when it changes `ui/` or the
  console specs, else in Chromium only.

## Mutation testing

The push hook runs it. Every surviving mutant is killed by a test or
explained in the PR body (testing rule 3).

## Slow lane

Tests that start real simulators or emulators. Run them only through
`scripts/slow-e2e.sh <test files>`:

- It holds a machine-wide lock, runs detached, prints its log path at once,
  and writes `<log>.exit` when the run ends.
- Exit 75: another run holds the lock; the script prints the holder.

The machine can run a line only if:

| Line needs | Check                                                      |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| iOS        | `uname -s` is `Darwin`; `xcrun simctl list runtimes` lists one |
| Android    | `command -v emulator adb` finds both                       |

A Done when line needs the slow lane when it needs a real simulator or
emulator. It says so in its own words ("on a Mac with an iOS runtime: ...")
and names the slow-lane test that proves it.

## Project checks

- **Published surfaces.** A change to a schema, a contract type or a
  validator reruns the tests of every surface that publishes it: MCP
  `tools/list`, HTTP error bodies, CLI help. A refinement can empty a
  published schema while every unit test stays green.
- **Contract shapes.** Every change to a contract shape bumps
  `DAEMON_PROTOCOL_VERSION` by one, so two tasks that change contract shapes
  overlap even when they touch different files.
