  "1. Check it is set up: run `simlock whoami`. If `simlock` is not found, or `whoami` fails, tell the user and do not touch any device.",
  "2. Get the rules: run `simlock instructions` and follow them. They match the installed Simlock, so read them again in each session instead of relying on memory.",
